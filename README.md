# Nim
The game of [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) coded in Python using the Pygame module.

## How to Play:
Two players take turns removing sticks from different piles. On their turn, a player must remove at least one stick from one of the piles, but may remove any number of sticks as long as they all come from that same pile. The player that avoids removing the last stick is the winner.

[A/B/C/D] - Remove a stick from the corresponding pile

[>] - Pass the turn to the other player

## Future Implementations:
* Option to randomize the number of piles and the number of sticks in each pile
* Option to play against AI
